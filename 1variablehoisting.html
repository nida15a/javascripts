      //hoisting:Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved
      //to the top of their scope before code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared,
      // they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
      // One of the benefits of hoisting is that it enables us to call functions before they appear in the code. JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.
